# Flight Route Optimization

This program parses a text file (`.txt`) containing information about airplane flights, such as origin airport and city, destination airport and city, distance, and cost. Based on this data, the program offers eight options, utilizing a variety of data structures and algorithms:
1. Builds and display the weighted, directed graph of all flights
2. Calculates and displays the shortest path between two airports using Djikstra's algorithm
3. Calculates and displays the shortest paths between an airport and all airports in a given state using Djikstra's algorithm
4. Finds and displays the shortest path between two airports in a given number of steps using modified Djikstra's algorithm and breadth-first search
5. Finds and displays the total direct flight connections to each airport using selection sort
6. Builds and displays an undirected graph
7. Builds and displays a minimum spanning tree (MST) with Prim's algorithm
8. Builds and displays a MST with Kruskal's algorithm

## Data Structures and Algorithms Used:
**Data Structures:** vertex, edge, graph, MinHeap, disjoint set
<br>**Algorithms:** Djikstra's algorithm, selection sort, Prim's algorithm (MST), Kruskal's algorithm (MST)

## Usage
Compile and run `main.cpp`.
